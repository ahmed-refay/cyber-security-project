1. Executive Summary
Purpose of the Test and Brief Overview of Key Findings
The purpose of this penetration test was to evaluate the security posture of the target application, identify critical vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate risks. Key findings include authentication weaknesses, sensitive information disclosure, and exploitable application logic vulnerabilities.
High-Level Impact and Critical Vulnerabilities
•	Critical Vulnerabilities Identified: 
o	Weak password policies leading to brute force attacks.
o	Exposure of sensitive endpoints and files (e.g., /ftp, /robots.txt).
o	Poor error handling revealing internal server configurations.
•	Impact: 
o	Unauthorized access to administrator accounts.
o	Exposure of sensitive data and potential data breaches.
o	Increased risk of exploitation through publicly accessible endpoints.
Summary of Recommendations
•	Implement strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.
•	Restrict access to sensitive directories and endpoints.
•	Harden application error handling to prevent information leakage.

3. Vulnerability Findings
3.1. Critical Vulnerabilities
i. Weak Authentication Mechanism
•	Description: The application allowed brute force attacks due to lack of account lockout and weak password policies.
•	Risk: High.
•	Potential Impact: Unauthorized access to administrator accounts.
•	Evidence: Successfully brute-forced admin credentials using Hydra.
•	Remediation Steps: 
o	Implement account lockout after repeated failed attempts.
o	Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity).
o	Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
ii. Sensitive Information Exposure via /robots.txt
•	Description: The robots.txt file contained disallowed paths pointing to sensitive endpoints (e.g., /ftp).
•	Risk: Medium.
•	Potential Impact: Attackers can use this file to discover hidden application functionalities.
•	Evidence: Analysis of robots.txt file using manual review.
•	Remediation Steps: 
o	Avoid listing sensitive endpoints in robots.txt.
o	Restrict access to sensitive directories using server configurations.
iii. Poor Error Handling
•	Description: Internal server errors (500) were displayed on endpoints like /profile and /redirect, exposing potential injection points.
•	Risk: Medium.
•	Potential Impact: Provides attackers with information to craft further exploits.
•	Evidence: Captured HTTP 500 responses using Burp Suite.
•	Remediation Steps: 
o	Implement custom error messages.
o	Log errors internally without displaying stack traces to users.

4. Exploitation and Attack Simulation
4.1. Tools and Techniques Used
•	Tools: Hydra, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.
•	Techniques: 
o	Brute force attacks on login endpoints.
o	Directory enumeration to discover hidden files and directories.
o	Injection attempts on exposed endpoints.
4.2. Outcome and Impact of the Attack
•	Gained unauthorized access to the administrator account via brute force attack.
•	Accessed sensitive files hosted under /ftp, including configuration files containing credentials.
•	Identified injection points that could lead to potential data manipulation or retrieval.

5. Conclusion
Summary of Security Posture Based on Findings
The penetration test revealed several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities that compromise the security of the application. These issues include weak authentication mechanisms, poor access controls, and sensitive information exposure.
Overall Risk Level and Next Steps for Remediation
•	Overall Risk Level: High
•	Next Steps: 
1.	Immediately address the identified critical vulnerabilities.
2.	Implement recommended security measures, including strong authentication policies, restricted access controls, and secure error handling.
3.	Perform a follow-up penetration test to validate the effectiveness of the implemented fixes.
